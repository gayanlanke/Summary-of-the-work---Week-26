  abstract = {As a common concept in multi-objective optimization, minimizing a weighted sum constitutes an independent method as well as a component of other methods. Consequently, insight into characteristics of the weighted sum method has far reaching implications. However, despite the many published applications for this method and the literature addressing its pitfalls with respect to depicting the Pareto optimal set, there is little comprehensive discussion concerning the conceptual significance of the weights and techniques for maximizing the effectiveness of the method with respect to a priori articulation of preferences. Thus, in this paper, we investigate the fundamental significance of the weights in terms of preferences, the Pareto optimal set, and objective-function values. We determine the factors that dictate which solution point results from a particular set of weights. Fundamental deficiencies are identified in terms of a priori articulation of preferences, and guidelines are provided to help avoid blind use of the method.},

  abstract = {The smart grid is conceived of as an electric grid that can deliver electricity in a controlled, smart way from points of generation to active consumers. Demand response (DR), by promoting the interaction and responsiveness of the customers, may offer a broad range of potential benefits on system operation and expansion and on market efficiency. Moreover, by improving the reliability of the power system and, in the long term, lowering peak demand, DR reduces overall plant and capital cost investments and postpones the need for network upgrades. In this paper a survey of DR potentials and benefits in smart grids is presented. Innovative enabling technologies and systems, such as smart meters, energy controllers, communication systems, decisive to facilitate the coordination of efficiency and DR in a smart grid, are described and discussed with reference to real industrial case studies and research projects.},
